This README.md file provides an overview of the "Huddle Landing Page Challenge" hosted on Frontend Mentor. This challenge involves creating a responsive landing page for the "Huddle" social media platform. For this particular completion, we focused on implementing the desktop version of the landing page.

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, you are provided with a design file (in either Figma or Sketch format) and a set of requirements. Your task is to create a responsive web page that matches the provided design as closely as possible. The challenge includes various components and responsive behavior for different screen sizes, making it a great opportunity to practice your CSS and HTML skills.

## Completed Version

For this completion, we have successfully implemented the desktop version of the Huddle Landing Page Challenge. The page is designed to look and behave as closely as possible to the provided design file for desktop screens.

## Technologies Used

To complete the challenge, we used the following technologies:

* HTML5: For structuring the webpage's content.
* CSS3: For styling the webpage and making it responsive.
* Visual Studio Code: As our code editor.
* Figma: For viewing and referencing the design file.
